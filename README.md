Coursework for DSD

Based on CORDIC algorithm, using bit shifting, adding, subtraction and look up table

Use Monte Carlo simulation technique

## Expected Precision

Mean square error (MSE) of 1*e-10

Confidence level of 95%

## Fixed Point Format

32-bit long

1 bit for sign

2 bits for integer parts

30 bits for decimal places

## Look Up Table

The length is being changed to find the optimum with the best precision

Currently, the length is changed to 16
